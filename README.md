## Start Here

This is a companion for the "Head first design pattern book".
It's kind of a template project for future references.
It's meant to learn both typescript and OOP design patterns.

## OOP Principles

- Encapsulate what varies.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Program to interfaces, not implementations.
- Think at the pattern level, note the object level.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between object that interact.
- Classes should be closed for modification and open to extension.
