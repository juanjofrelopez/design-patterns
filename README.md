## Start Here

This is a companion for the "Head first design pattern book".
It's kind of a template project for future references.
It's meant to learn both typescript and OOP design patterns.

## Pattern index

- Strategy -> duck
- Observer -> weather
- Decorator -> coffe
- Factory -> pizza
- Singleton -> chocolate
- Command -> remote
- Adapter -> adapter
- Facade -> facade
- Template Method -> beverage
- Iterator -> menues
- Composite

## OOP Principles

- Encapsulate what varies.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Program to interfaces, not implementations.
- Think at the pattern level, note the object level.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between object that interact.
- Classes should be closed for modification and open to extension.
- Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes. (Dependency Inversion Principle).
- Least knowlede: talk only to your inmediate friends.
- The hollywood principle: Don't call us, we'll call you. High level components decide when and how to call low level components.

## Tips and tricks

- All principles should be used when they are helpful.
- All design involves tradeoffs (abstraction vs speed, space vs time, etc).
- Take all factors into account before applying principles.
